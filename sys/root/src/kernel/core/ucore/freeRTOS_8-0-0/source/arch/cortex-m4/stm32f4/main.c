 * >>>>>> NOTE 1: <<<<<<
 *
 * main() can be configured to create either a very simple LED flasher demo, or
 * a more comprehensive test/demo application.
 *
 * To create a very simple LED flasher example, set the
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_LED_FLASHER_DEMO_ONLY constant (defined below) to 1.  When
 * this is done, only the standard demo flash tasks are created.  The standard
 * demo flash example creates three tasks, each of which toggle an LED at a
 * fixed but different frequency.
 *
 * To create a more comprehensive test and demo application, set
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_LED_FLASHER_DEMO_ONLY to 0.
 *
 * >>>>>> NOTE 2: <<<<<<
 *
 * In addition to the normal set of standard demo tasks, the comprehensive test
 * makes heavy use of the floating point unit, and forces floating point
 * instructions to be used from interrupts that nest three deep.  The nesting
 * starts from the tick hook function, resulting is an abnormally long context
 * switch time.  This is done purely to stress test the FPU context switching
 * implementation, and that part of the test can be removed by setting
 * configUSE_TICK_HOOK to 0 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main() creates all the demo application tasks and software timers, then starts
 * the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of the standard
 * demo application tasks, which provide no particular functionality, but do
 * provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill both the core and floating point registers with
 * known values, then check that each register maintains its expected value for
 * the lifetime of the task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg
 * test tasks execute with a very low priority, so get preempted very
 * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 * "Check" timer - The check software timer period is initially set to three
 * seconds.  The callback function associated with the check software timer
 * checks that all the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks, are
 * not only still executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If
 * the check software timer discovers that a task has either stalled, or
 * reported an error, then it changes its own execution period from the initial
 * three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check software timer callback function
 * also toggles an LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual
 * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every three seconds,
 * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then
 * an issue has been discovered with at least one task.
 *
 * Tick hook - The application tick hook is called from the schedulers tick
 * interrupt service routine when configUSE_TICK_HOOK is set to 1 in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h.  In this example, the tick hook is used to test the kernels
 * handling of the floating point units (FPU) context, both at the task level
 * and when nesting interrupts access the floating point unit registers.  The
 * tick hook function first fills the FPU registers with a known value, it
 * then triggers a medium priority interrupt.  The medium priority interrupt
 * fills the FPU registers with a different value, and triggers a high priority
 * interrupt.  The high priority interrupt once again fills the the FPU
 * registers with a known value before returning to the medium priority
 * interrupt.  The medium priority interrupt checks that the FPU registers
 * contain the values that it wrote to them, then returns to the tick hook
 * function.  Finally, the tick hook function checks that the FPU registers
 * contain the values that it wrote to them, before it too returns.
 *
 * Button interrupt - The button marked "USER" on the starter kit is used to
 * demonstrate how to write an interrupt service routine, and how to synchronise
 * a task with an interrupt.  A task is created that blocks on a test semaphore.
 * When the USER button is pressed, the button interrupt handler gives the
 * semaphore, causing the task to unblock.  When the task unblocks, it simply
 * increments an execution count variable, then returns to block on the
 * semaphore again.
