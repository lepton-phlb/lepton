 * A "Check" task is created in addition to the standard demo tasks.    This

 * processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the standard demo
 * tasks are still operational.  If everything is running as expected then the
 * check task will toggle an LED every 3 seconds.  An error being discovered in
 * any task will cause the toggle rate to increase to 500ms.
