Dear embOS tester,

Manufacturer- and CPU-specific start projects
are located in the subfolders of the "BoardSupport" folder.

The projects should serve as an "easy start" with embOS.
All paths are relative to the project files.
You should therefore be able to copy the
entire "Start" directory (including all subdirectories)
to any location on your harddrive.

Please make sure all files are r/w.
If you have CSpy (the IAR debugger),
check out this start application by clicking
the CSpy-symbol in the task bar

Thank you for trying out embOS !

P.S.:
This trial version of embOS is limited to
a maximum of 3 tasks. You may only use
it in order to evaluate embOS for fitness
for a particular purpose.
Under no circumstances it may be used in
a product. If you would like to use
it in a product, please get in touch with
use:
www.segger.com   info@segger.com

(embOS is priced reasonably and is
royalty-free)

Thank you for your fairness.
